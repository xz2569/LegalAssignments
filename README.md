# Legal Assignments

Algorithms to
- obtain the Student-Optimal Legal Assignments
- obtain the School-Optimal Legal Assignments
- obtain all legal edges (for the subinstance whose set of stable assignments corresponds to the set of legal assignments in the original instance)
- visualize the distributive lattice formed by all legal assignments

Please refer to exmaple.m to learn how to use our scripts.

Some exemplary plots of lattice are included in folder Lattices/.
